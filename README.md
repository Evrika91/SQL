# SQL

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I have created and verified through my experience using SQLite databases. As a student at Warsaw School of Economics, I have gained practical experience working with databases consisting of two to four tables, and have developed a solid understanding of JOINs, including left, right, and inner joins. The queries I will be sharing include SELECT, HAVING, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY statements. With this repository, I hope to share my knowledge and help others learn more about SQL and database management.
